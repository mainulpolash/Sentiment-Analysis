# Sentiment-Analysis
** In this problem, I evaluate a pre-trained model with an industry level dataset for Sentiment Analysis task.

** Dataset: I choose IMDB dataset containing almost 50,000 movie reviews. The dataset is balanced, so accuracy would be a good metric to evaluate the performance on this data. As my machine doesn't have a GPU, I split the dataset into 20,000 train data and 10,000 test data. Each sample contain two sections. First section contains the review, second section contains whether the review is positive or negative. Download the dataset on the designated folder told in the program.

** Task: My task is to use a deep learning model to find the total number of positive and negative review by prediction and evaluate the predicted using accuracy.

** Instruction:
  **To run the code please install tensorflow and tensor hub in your python package. If any other import function is not available in your python, you also need to install those.
